# Penguin Memory Game

A challenging memory game where players need to find matching penguins across three increasingly difficult levels.

## Game Overview

The game challenges players to find matching penguins hidden behind snow mounds. As players progress through levels, the complexity increases with more penguins to match and the introduction of obstacles.

### Level 1 - Easy

### Level 2 - Medium

- 24 tiles with increased difficulty

- Game continues after Yeti encounter

### Level 3 - Hard
